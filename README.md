# AoC2023
Programs for Advent of Code 2023
Warning: contains quickly written code that has not been mostly cleaned and refactored.


## How to use
Enter the number for the day you want to run, and enter the input. Once you do that, type in "end".
By typing "paste" in the input reader, you can make the program read your clipboard for input.  
Alternatively, you can paste the input if your terminal allows it. This may be slow.  
For CMD: Right click the top bar and select Edit>Paste

Or if you're one of those piping types you can put your input in a text file in a format like this:  
```
1
two1nine
eightwothree
abcone2threexyz
xtwone3four
4nineeightseven2
zoneight234
7pqrstsixteen
end
0

```
To use this with batch, do `type input.txt | AoC2023.exe`  
This will run the first program.  
Be sure to keep in the last newline.
